# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Recommendation System

## Short Description
Built a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering (SVD). Predicted ratings and recommended top-rated titles for a user based on their past preferences using Python and the Surprise library.

## Extended Description
This capstone project focuses on building a personalized recommendation engine using collaborative filtering. The model analyzes a specific userâ€™s (userId: 1331154) rating behavior and uses the SVD algorithm to predict ratings for unseen movies. Based on these predictions, it generates a ranked list of recommended titles most likely to interest the user.

The Surprise library was used for model building and evaluation, with 3-fold cross-validation to measure performance (RMSE and MAE). The final output includes a sorted list of top recommendations based on predicted ratings.

This project showcases the practical application of recommender system techniques and serves as a strong portfolio piece for data science and machine learning roles.
